# Personal Website  

This repository contains the source code for my personal [webpage](https://inauenma.github.io/), built using the [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template. AcademicPages is a Jekyll-based template designed for academic personal websites, forked from the Minimal Mistakes theme.
